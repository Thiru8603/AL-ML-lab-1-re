Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict student performance based on various factors such as disability status and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) band. We'll be using logistic regression, a common technique for binary classification problems.

Data
The data used in this project is stored in a CSV file named studentInfo.csv. It includes information about students, such as final results, disability status, and IMD band.

Setup
Loading Libraries: We start by loading the necessary libraries, including tidymodels.
Reading Data: The data is read into R from the CSV file using read.csv.
Data Exploration: We examine the structure of the data to understand its columns and types.
Feature Engineering
We perform some feature engineering steps to prepare the data for modeling:

Creating Target Variable: We create a binary target variable pass based on the final_result column.
Converting Factors: We convert pass and disability variables into factors.
Feature Transformation: We convert the imd_band variable into an ordered factor and then into an integer.
Modeling
Splitting Data: We split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
Creating Recipe: We create a recipe specifying the predictors (disability and imd_band) and the target variable (pass).
Specifying Model: We specify a logistic regression model using logistic_reg from tidymodels.
Building Workflow: We build a workflow by adding the model and recipe.
Fitting Model: We fit the model to the training data.
Evaluation
Resampling: We create a resampling object for the testing data.
Model Evaluation: We evaluate the model performance using the testing data.
Interpreting Accuracy: We calculate the accuracy of the model predictions.
